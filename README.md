PEC: Period Error Calculator  

**Abstract**
The PEC (**P**eriod **E**rror **C**alculator) algorithm estimates the period error for eclipsing binaries observed by NASA's Kepler astrophysical mission &mdash; especially those in the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog. The algorithm is based on propagation of error theory and assumes that observation of every light curve peak/minimum in a long time-series observation can be unambiguously identified. A simple C implementation of the PEC algorithm is available at https://github.com/KenMighell/pec/blob/main/pec.c
